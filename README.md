If you find any mod that adds its own drops to the game and they don't show in NEI then feel free to open an issue!

## Configuration

There are two configuration files `mobsinfo.cfg` and `MobOverrides.json` in `/config/mobsinfo/` directory that should generate at first launch.
There will also be third file called `MobRecipeLoader.cache` but it is to make your game start faster next time, so dont edit it!
You can turn various features on and off in there including:
- Hidden mode
- Infernal drops NEI page
- Show all EnderIO spawners in NEI!
- Mob blacklist

## Override Config
Sometimes there are cases where it is impossible to generate loot that the mob gives.
In this cases you can manually edit the information on the page with the override config.

You can find it in .minecraft\config\MobsInfo\MobOverrides.json

Example file should generate at first start
